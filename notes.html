Mary had a little toad <br>
Its skin as tough as shell <br>
And every file that toad would write <br>
It used HTML.<br>
<p>Once upon a time there was a baby tiger named <mark>Talia</mark>.</p>
<p>Talia lived in a <sub>fearsome jungle</sub>
  in the middle of the <sup>fearsome jungle</sup>.</p>
<p>Talia was the most fearsome of all, </p>
<p>though she was only a baby.</p>
